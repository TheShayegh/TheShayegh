### Python Frameworks:

* **Spiral** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cnrl/Spiral)]
<br/>A python package for spiking neural network simulation using PyTorch on CUDA or CPU. This package tries to bring its design as close as possible to biological observations of how the nervous system functions. We have a long way to go for a mature package that covers all the needs you might have dealing with spiking neural networks. Yet this package is still an infant child.

### Python packages:

* **Add-on Class** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/add-on-class)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/add-on-class/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/add-on-class)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/add-on-class)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_linkedin-activity-7082411778243993600-7Pxy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> This package provides you with a module that allows you to easily define classes that are stacked on top of each other and add features to each other, creating a whole new class.

* **Construction Requirements Integrator** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/construction-requirements-integrator)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/construction-requirements-integrator/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/construction-requirements-integrator)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/add-on-class)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_linkedin-activity-7051696476644651008-q2oc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> Using this module, we can inherit classes configuring after their requirements are met (instead of being launched immediately after creation).

* **Matplotlib Dashboard** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/matplotlib-dashboard)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib-dashboard/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/add-on-class)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/matplotlib-dashboard)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_matplotlib-dashboard-activity-6987923239796695040-vFRH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> This package creates a simple user interface for creating subfigures when working with matplotlib.

* **Constant Properties Protector** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/constant-properties-protector)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/constant-properties-protector/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/constant-properties-protector)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/constant-properties-protector)]
<br/> With the help of this module, you can protect some of the properties in a class. Protecting means avoiding changing them but keeping them publicly available.

### LaTeX Templates

* Persian Textbook (Math-related) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OpenBookshelf/PersianTextbookTemplate)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_github-openbookshelfpersiantextbooktemplate-activity-7111515543085412352-DskN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]

### Papers' Implementations
* Tree-Averaging Algorithms for Ensemble-Based Unsupervised Discontinuous Constituency Parsing [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MANGA-UOFA/TAA4EUDCP)] [[Paper](#)]
* Ensemble Distillation for Unsupervised Constituency Parsing [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MANGA-UOFA/ED4UCP)] [[Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RR8y0WKrFv)]
* Geolocating Addresses from Informal Persian Texts using Hierarchical Kernel-Based Bayesian Models [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/PAT)] [[Article](https://TheShayegh.github.io/PAT/)]

### Educational Contents

* **Discrete Mathematics Persian Book** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OpenBookshelf/DiscreteMathematics-Persian)]
<br/> This is an open-source self-learning Persian textbook on discrete mathematics provided by volunteers without any expectation and offered for free. In producing this content, we didn't pay any costs and only used open-source and free platforms. Any use and distribution of this digital content are unrestricted as long as it does not generate revenue. People involved in creating this content will devote their time and effort to the public and not accept its commercial use. If you also like the exquisite taste of free education, we welcome and appreciate any help continuing this.

* **Applied Probability and Statistics in R** (Persian) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/AppliedProbabilityAndStatisticsInR)]
<br/> Discusses and solves practical examples of probability and statistics in R. It has been written in Persian.

* **Common Mistakes in Discrete Mathematics** (Persian) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/soudabemhashemi/Common-Mistakes-in-Discrete-Mathematics)]
<br/> It contains a set of problems; each problem has one or more wrong or incomplete answers that cover the most common mistakes made in that subject. We explain each error in detail and provide a complete solution at the end to help the reader understand the points. It has been written in Persian.

* **Python Exercises** (English) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/PythonTutorialExercises)]
<br/>A Jupyter notebook that brings up and solves a series of Python exercises that are prepared for a data science workshop.

* **Basic C++ Exercises** (Persian) [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheShayegh/ExtraSolutionsAndCodes-44plus45/)]
<br/> Brings up and solves many basic exercises in C++. It has been written in Persian.

### Other Tools and Stuff

* **Bracket-based Tree Visualizer** [[Tool](https://TheShayegh.github.io/BracketBased3Visualizer/)]
<br/> Minimal visualizer for constituency trees. It receives the bracket-based representation of a tree (explained in the tool itself) and visualizes it graphically.
