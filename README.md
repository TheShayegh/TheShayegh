### My Python Frameworks:
* **Spiral** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cnrl/Spiral)]
<br/>A python package for spiking neural network simulation using PyTorch on CUDA or CPU. This package tries to bring its design as close as possible to biological observations of how the nervous system functions. We have a long way to go for a mature package that covers all needs you might have dealing with spiking neural networks. Yet this package is still an infant child.

### My Python packages:
* **Add-on Class** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShayeghB/add-on-class)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/add-on-class/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/add-on-class)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/add-on-class)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_linkedin-activity-7082411778243993600-7Pxy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> This package provides you with a module that allows you to easily define classes that are stacked on top of each other and add features to each other, creating a whole new class.
* **Construction Requirements Integrator** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShayeghB/construction-requirements-integrator)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/construction-requirements-integrator/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/construction-requirements-integrator)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/add-on-class)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_linkedin-activity-7051696476644651008-q2oc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> Using this module, we can inherit classes configuring after their requirements are met (instead of being launched immediately after creation).
* **Matplotlib Dashboard** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShayeghB/matplotlib-dashboard)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib-dashboard/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/add-on-class)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/matplotlib-dashboard)] [[LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shayeghb_matplotlib-dashboard-activity-6987923239796695040-vFRH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]
<br/> This package creates a simple user interface for creating subfigures when working with matplotlib.
* **Constant Properties Protector/** [[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShayeghB/constant-properties-protector)] [[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/constant-properties-protector/)] [[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/constant-properties-protector)] [[PePy](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/constant-properties-protector)]
<br/> With the help of this module, you can protect some of the properties in a class. Protecting means avoiding to change them but keep them publicly available.
